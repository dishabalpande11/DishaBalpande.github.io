# Generate_Faces_using_GAN

I’m defining and training a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. The goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible.

I’m using the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) to train the adversarial networks. source

Sample results after only 40 epochs are presented below:
