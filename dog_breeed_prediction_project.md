# dog_breeed_prediction_project

Classifying 133 dog breeds using CNN and Transfer Learning

## Project Overview

In this project,learn how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification and localization,that by completing this lab, I understand the challenges involved in Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience.

Build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images.
Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If supplied an image of a human face, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

## Detect Humans

Assess the Human Face Detector The submission returns the percentage of the first 100 images in the dog and human face datasets that include a detected, human face.

## Detect Dogs

Use a pre-trained VGG16 Net to find the predicted class for a given image: dog_detector function returns True if a dog is detected in an image and False if not.

Assess the Dog Detector The submission returns the percentage of the first 100 images in the dog and human face datasets that include a detected dog.

## CNN to Classify Dog Breeds from Scratch

CNN architecture of trained model attains at least 10% accuracy on the test set.

## CNN to Classify Dog Breeds Using Transfer Learning

Model architecture that uses part of a pre-trained model with accuracy on the test set of 60% or greater.
