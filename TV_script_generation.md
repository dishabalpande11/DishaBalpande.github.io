# TV_script_generation

I'm generating my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I'm using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. 
The Neural Network will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

## Project Steps

1. Explore the Data and Implement Pre-processing Functions
2. Build the Neural Network 
   - Build the Neural Network 
3. Neural Network Training 
   - Train Loop
   - Hyperparameters
   - Train
4. Generate TV Script 
   - Generate a new script
